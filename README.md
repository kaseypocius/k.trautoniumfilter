# k.trautoniumfilter
5 takes on the [Doepfer 104 Trautonium Formant Filter](https://doepfer.de/a100_man/A104_man.pdf) made in Max between 2017 & 2018. More models added in 2022. To be run in a bpatcher. 

The models are largely similar, but explore different ways of distorting and saturating the signals

V1 - Clean/No Saturation<br/>
V2 - Changes in Filter Behaviour, no saturation<br/>
V3 - Peak Limited per filter<br/>
V4 - Wavefolding per band via pong<br/>
V5 - Wavefolding per band via pong, with 10x Wavefolding on the input and summed output - a gain of 0.1 is unity<br/>
